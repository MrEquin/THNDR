Fake Server Nuke, has a 18-Character check on server id to add the feeling of legitimacy to the user.
After filling the information asked click Start which then it will do a redirect to a Jurassic Park video of "You didn't say the magic word".
Every 3 seconds the loading message will change and the loading time can be extended but not recommended to change or else the loading bar maybe full but nothing happens.
Redirect link can be changed easily.
Pure Troll, this was not made will malicious intent.
